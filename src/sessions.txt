//stores data into session and saves it to redis
req.session.userId = user.id;

{userId: 1} -> send that to redis


//redis is a key-value store. This means you have a key to look up values
1
//first its stored in redis
//in redis the object will have a key mapped to the object. 
//if you give redis the key it will grant you access to the object data
sess:qwoeiuowqjoqjw -> { userId: 1 }

2
//signed version of the key is sent to the browser
express-session will set a cookie on my browser. Might look like this -> qwoieu9012798quw9euoe1i2uo

3
when user makes a request
qwoieu9012798quw9euoe1i2uo -> sent to the server

4
server decrypts the cookie
qwoieu9012798quw9euoe1i2uo -> sess:qwoeiuowqjoqjw

5
server makes a request to redis and gets data
sess:qwoeiuowqjoqjw -> { userId: 1 }

req.session = { userId: 1 }
